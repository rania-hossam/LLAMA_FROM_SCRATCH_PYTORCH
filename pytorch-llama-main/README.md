## What is LlaMA?

LlaMA is a group of foundational Large Language Models developed by Meta AI. It was announced by Meta in February of 2023. LlaMA is available in various sizes, ranging from 7 billion to 65 billion parameters, with a context length of 2,000 tokens. These models are designed to assist researchers in advancing their knowledge in the field of AI. The smaller 7 billion parameter models enable researchers with limited computational resources to study and experiment with these models.

### Key Features

- LlaMA models come in multiple sizes, making them suitable for various applications.
- Completely open-source and free for non-commercial use.
- Meta AI has released the LlaMA model weights for researchers.

## A Step Forward: LlaMA 2

LlaMA 2 is the second version of LlaMA, surpassing the initial release, LlaMA version 1, which Meta introduced in July of 2023. LlaMA 2 is available in three sizes: 7 billion, 13 billion, and 70 billion parameter models. Upon its release, LlaMA 2 achieved the highest score on Hugging Face, a popular platform for AI model deployment and fine-tuning. Across all segments (7B, 13B, and 70B), LlaMA 2 models have consistently outperformed other models available on Hugging Face, thanks to fine-tuning and retraining efforts.

### LlaMA 2 Highlights

- Trained on 2 trillion pretraining tokens.
- Offers a context length of 4,000 tokens, which is twice the context length of LlaMA 1.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art open-source models in various benchmarks, including MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Question, HumanEval, and more.
- LlaMA 2 has been fine-tuned for chat-related use cases with over 1 million human annotations, making it suitable for conversational AI applications.

## Usage

LlaMA models, including LlaMA 2, can be accessed and utilized through the Hugging Face website and platform. Researchers and developers are encouraged to explore the comprehensive benchmark scores, fine-tuned models, and documentation available on Meta AI's website for detailed information on how to use LlaMA effectively.
